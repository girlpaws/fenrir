# RevoltGo
Go package that provides low-level bindings to the Revolt API, just like discordgo

## Warning
This project is still under heavy development and is not fully complete. It is strongly recommended not to use this in production yet. Major parts are still being re-coded and improved; some features may not work as expected.

## Support server
We have a Revolt server dedicated to this project.

## Why this project is being made
After a brief skim through libraries for Revolt's API in Go, it became evident that everyone is writing suboptimal, garbage code with poor design choices and missing features, which are probably the result of the poor design making it hard to add on-to. Ofcourse nobody is perfect, and I may end up writing garbage as well, but at least the baseline quality will be much higher.

Another reason this project is being developed is because as someone who comes from discordgo, it would be nice to see something familiar. This would make it easier for new developers to transition into Revolt.
